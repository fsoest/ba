Due to the increasing availability of data and computing power, machine learning methods have become a standard approach in many fields such as natural language processing \cite{DBLP:journals/corr/VaswaniSPUJGKP17}.
Additionally, these methods are being applied to a broad range of problems in the physical sciences, from statistical physics to quantum computing \cite{Carleo_2019, wise2021using}.

Machine learning has also found use in the field of energy harvesting, concerned with extracting energy from external excitations, e.g. vibrations in human motion \cite{Liu2019}.
In this work we extend this concept to the quantum case.
We examine a system that can be driven by an arbitrary excitation, modelled as a time-dependent system Hamiltonian.
The Transducer is modelled in a similar fashion and can extract work from the system following the framework in \cite{beyer2020}.
We train neural networks to predict Transducer protocols given a Drive sequence, considering both the case where the sequence is known beforehand and the one where it is not.

The remainder of this work is structured as follows.
In Chapter \ref{background} we review the collision model framework used in our approach and introduce two machine learning architectures.
We investigate the system under consideration in Section \ref{dep_dt} and apply the aforementioned architectures in Sections \ref{n_2_ml} to \ref{work_cost}.
We summarise our findings and provide an outlook in Chapter \ref{outlook}.
