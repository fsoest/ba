The training data is created using a minimisation algorithm \cite{2020SciPy-NMeth}, which finds the optimal Transducer protocol $\{|\psi_T^i \rangle\}$ given a Drive sequence $\{|\psi_D^i \rangle\}$.
The networks are trained to learn the mapping $\{|\psi_D^i \rangle\} \to \{|\psi_T^i \rangle\}$.
Both the input (Drive) and output (Transducer) are transformed by the embedding
\begin{align*}
	\left\{
	\begin{pmatrix}
	\theta^i & \phi^i \\
	\end{pmatrix}
	\right\}
	\to
	\left\{
	\begin{pmatrix}
	\sin(\theta^i) & \sin(\phi^i) & \cos(\theta^i)  & \cos(\phi^i) \\
	\end{pmatrix}
	\right\}.
\end{align*}
The reasons for this operation are twofold: it normalises the data to the interval $[-1, 1]$, which is beneficial to learning \cite{LeCun2012}. Additionally it encodes information regarding the periodicity of the qubit angle representation.
We add either a zero or a one as an extra input parameter for LSTM training depending on whether or not the input is the last in a sequence.


To compare the accuracy of different models a performance indicator is required. 
Naturally one might use the MSE as introduced in section \ref{sml}.
Instead we define the \textit{efficiency} of a model $\textfrak{N}$ on a dataset $\{(\vec{x}_i, \vec{y}_i)\}$ as
\begin{align}
	\eta = \frac{1}{N} \sum_{i=1}^N \frac{W(\vec{x}_i,\textfrak{N}(\vec{x}_i))}{W(\vec{x}_i,\vec{y}_i)},
\end{align}
i.e. the arithmetic mean of the ratios of work output predicted by the model to optimal work output.
The function $W(\vec{x}_i, \vec{y}_i) = W(\{\ket{\psi_D}\}_i, \{\ket{\psi_T}\}_i)$ returns the work given a Drive and Transducer protocol.

It should be noted that using the MSE for training is not the only choice, and perhaps not the obvious.
Directly using the work extracted is possibly a more intuitive choice, but we refrain from it in the first section for two main reasons.
Firstly, the interaction Hamiltonian must be known to the experimenter for use as a cost function.
Secondly, the computation of the extracted work becomes costly for larger $N$, as calculating the work is $O(N-1)$ while MSE $= O(1)$.
