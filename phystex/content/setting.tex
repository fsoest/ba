Our setting consists of three qubits: the Drive, System and Transducer qubits. The Drive and Transducer qubits can be set by the experimenter in N discrete steps modelled as piecewise constant functions (PWC) of ($\theta_D, \phi_D$) and ($\theta_T, \phi_T$) respectively (see figure \ref{pwc}), the system qubit is initialised in a pure state.
As Drive and Transducer are assumed to be piecewise constant and therefore pure, we model both qubits as ancillary systems introduced in section \ref{col_model} (see figure \ref{collmodel}).

In the remainder of this work we use the interaction Hamiltonian on the three qubit Hilbert space
\begin{equation*}
	H_{DST} = H_{I} \otimes \mathds{1}_T + \mathds{1}_D \otimes H_{I}, \\
	H_{I} = \sigma_{+} \otimes \sigma_{-} + \sigma_{-} \otimes \sigma_{+}
\end{equation*}
unless otherwise noted.
The time evolution and work extraction is then calculated as follows, where $\Delta \mathrm{T}$ is time span between qubit switching:
\begin{align}
	H_S^i = \bra{\psi_D^i}\bra{\psi_T^i} H_{DST} \ket{\psi_D^i} \ket{\psi_T^i} \\
	\rho_S^{i+1} = U^i \rho_S^i U^{i\dagger}, \ U^i = e^{-iH_S^i \Delta \mathrm{T}} \\
	W = - \Sigma_i \mathrm{Tr} \ \rho_S^i \ dH_S^i \\
	dH_S^i = \bra{\psi_D^i}\bra{\psi_T^{i+1}} H_{DST} \ket{\psi_D^i} \ket{\psi_T^{i+1}} - \bra{\psi_D^i}\bra{\psi_T^i} H_{DST} \ket{\psi_D^i} \ket{\psi_T^i}.	
\end{align}
Here we use the partial Hamiltonian $H_S^i$ on S at time step $i \in [1, N - 1]$, as well as corresponding system density matrix $\rho_S^i$.
