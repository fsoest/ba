In this work we used Long Short-Term Memory networks to predict transducer policies given an excitation driving a two-level quantum system.
The performance was compared to the lower bound derived through local optimisation.
We demonstrated that our approach is capable of predicting transducer policies that will produce a positive work output given a drive data set.
We found that the efficiency greatly depends on the model parameters $N$ and $\Delta \mathrm{T}$.
For $N=2$ and $\rho_0 = \ket{+}\bra{+}$, where an analytic optimum exists, a simple linear network is able to reproduce the optimal policy.
For the higher-dimensional case $N=5$, we examined two switching times $\Delta \mathrm{T}$, finding that the network performs better on the shorter than the longer time.
For $\Delta \mathrm{T} = 5$ were unable to outperform the lower bound and were only able to extract 33.1 \% of the optimum.



In all cases the bidirectional outperforms the unidirectional LSTM, as the former has access to the complete drive sequence while the latter can only make predictions from the previous and current drive qubits.


We identified the use of the mean squared error as a disadvantage in calculating the loss during training.



Instead, following an approach similar to those in \cite{Banchi_2018, PhysRevX.10.011006}, where recurrent neural networks are used to directly model the system dynamics, might alleviate these shortcomings.

An extension to the model is to add dissipative effects to the system state $\rho_S$.

It has to be noted that the approach followed in this work depends on maximising expectation values of work outputs.
While this is certainly justified in the limit of infinite experimental realisations, the question of how the results might differ in the single shot case remains.
A reinforcement learning based approach, where problems are usually formulated as Markov Decision Problems and probabilistic reward functions are common \cite{Sutton1998}, would be a suitable alternative.
