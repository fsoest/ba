For $\rho_0 = \ket{+} \bra{+}$, or $a = e^{-i \phi_D}/\sqrt{2}, b = 1/\sqrt{2}$ following the notation used in appendix \ref{deriv_jump}, finding the optimal solution of $\mathrm{dW}$ for $N = 2$ requires finding the Transducer setting that ensures
\begin{align}\label{commutator}
	[H_{DS}, H_S] = [\delta \sigma_{+} + \delta^* \sigma_{-}, \alpha \sigma_{+} + \alpha^* \sigma_{-}] = 0
\end{align}
with $\delta = \frac{1}{2} \sin{\theta_D} e^{i \phi_D}$.
Considering only the principal branch, \ref{commutator} is equivalent to
\begin{align*}
	\Im{\alpha \delta^*} = 0 \implies \arg{\alpha} = \phi_D \implies a b^* = a^* b \frac{\alpha^*}{\alpha},
\end{align*}
which leads to the independence of dW with regard to $\Delta \mathrm{T}$.
