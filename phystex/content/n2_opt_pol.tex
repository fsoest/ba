For $\rho_0 = \ket{+} \bra{+}$, or $a = e^{-i \phi_D}/\sqrt{2}, b = 1/\sqrt{2}$ following the notation used in appendix \ref{deriv_jump}, finding the optimal solution of $\mathrm{dW}$ for $N = 2$ is equivalent to solving $a b^* = a^* b \frac{\alpha^*}{\alpha}$.
This leads to the optimality condition
\begin{align}\label{opt_cond}
	\arg{\alpha} = \phi_D,
\end{align}
considering only the principal branch. This ensures $[H_{DS}, H_S] = 0$ and leads to the independence of the work output with regard to $\Delta \mathrm{T}$.
