\section{Local optimisation protocol}
In this section we derive a lower bound on the extractable work given a drive sequence $\{\ket{\psi_D^i}\}$ when the system state $\rho_S$ is initialised in the eigenstate $\ket{+}\bra{+}$ with higher eigenvalue of the partial system Hamiltonian $H_{DS} = \bra{\psi_D}\bra{\psi_T} H_I \otimes \mathds{1}_T \ket{\psi_D} \ket{\psi_T}$.
By following a policy where the work output of each step $dW$ is optimised locally, we find that the transducer can be chosen such that $dW \geq 0$ for all drives.

We start in an eigenstate of the drive Hamiltonian, without loss of generality let $H_{DS} \propto \sigma_x$.
By local optimisation we find $H_{ST}' = -\frac{\sigma_x}{2}, H_{ST} = \frac{\sigma_x}{2}$.
This extracts the maximal $dW = 1$.

We now examine the following step and generalise to an arbitrary state with zero y-component $\rho_S = (\cos(\theta/2) \ket{0} + \sin(\theta/2) \ket{1})(\cos(\theta/2) \bra{0} + \sin(\theta/2) \bra{1})$.
Note that its projection onto the x-y-plane on the Bloch sphere is anti-parallel to the transducer, which is determined by the previous optimisation as $H_{ST} = -\frac{\sigma_x}{2}$.
The total system Hamiltonian is given by
\begin{align*}
H &= H_{DS} + H_{ST} =  \delta \sigma_+ + \delta^* \sigma_{-} - \frac{\sigma_x}{2} =: \alpha \sigma_+ + h.c. = \Re{\alpha} \sigma_x + \Im{\alpha} \sigma_y, \\
\delta &= \sin{\theta_D} e^{i\phi_D} / 2.
\end{align*}
Consider then an evolved state $\rho_S' =\frac{1}{2} (\mathds{1} + \vec{r} \cdot \vec{\sigma})$, with $\vec{r} = ( x, y, z )$, where $\vec{r}$ would be determined by a unitary transformation in our case (note that the following is valid for any CPTP operation). The step work output $dW$ is then given by
\begin{align*}
dW &= \Tr{\rho' (H_{ST} - H'_{ST})} = \Tr{\rho' \left(-\frac{\sigma_x}{2} - \Re{\tau} \sigma_x - \Im{\tau} \sigma_y \right)} \\
&= -\frac{x}{2} - \Re{\tau} x - \Im{\tau} y, \\
\tau &= \frac{1}{2} \sin{\theta_T} e^{i\phi_T}. 
\end{align*}
$dW$ has a maximum for $\theta_T = \frac{\pi}{2}, \phi_T = \arctan{\frac{y}{x}} + \pi$, giving
\begin{align*}
dW_{lo} = \frac{1}{2}\left(\sqrt{x^2 + y^2} -x\right) \geq 0 \ \forall x, y.
\end{align*}
$H'_{ST}$ is again anti-parallel to the projection of $\rho'_S$ onto the x-y-plane and thus the prerequisite (after a passive transformation) for the above is given.

$a$ only depends on the current $\ket{\psi_D}$ and $\rho_S$.
For a given drive sequence the sum of the locally optimised work outputs $dW_{lo}$ provides a lower bound on the total extractable work as each contribution is non-negative. In the following chapter we will show that protocols with higher outputs exist by optimising globally over all time steps.
